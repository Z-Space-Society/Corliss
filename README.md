# Corliss — ATProto login, OIDC out

Corliss lets people sign in with their **ATProto handle** (Bluesky et al.)
instead of yet another account, and re-exposes that session to your own
services as a standard **OIDC provider**.

It is a bridge between two protocols:

- **In** — a full ATProto OAuth *client*: handle → DID → PDS discovery → PAR +
  PKCE + DPoP + `private_key_jwt`, ending in a DID-keyed Django session.
- **Out** — an OIDC *provider*: discovery, authorize, token, JWKS, minting an
  RS256 `id_token` whose `sub` is the member's DID.

Anything that speaks OIDC (Open WebUI, Grafana, …) can sit behind it.

## Layout

Corliss is a **single Django app**. Three models, one URL table; the two
protocol halves are plain modules, not sub-apps. A future subsystem earns its
own app only by being genuinely standalone.

| Module | Responsibility |
| ------ | -------------- |
| `corliss/models.py` | `User` (DID-keyed), `AtprotoToken` (server-side PDS tokens + DPoP key), `OidcAuthCode`. |
| `corliss/atproto.py` | ATProto OAuth client: client metadata, DPoP, handle/DID resolution, PDS discovery, PAR, token exchange. |
| `corliss/oidc.py` | OIDC provider core: discovery document, auth-code issuance, `id_token` minting. |
| `corliss/views.py` | Every HTTP endpoint, both halves. |
| `corliss/urls.py` | Every route, flat and un-namespaced. |
| `corliss/signing.py` | Loads the signing keys, builds the JWKS. |

Two signing keys, one JWKS: **ES256 (P-256)** for atproto DPoP + client
assertion (atproto mandates it) and **RS256 (RSA)** for the OIDC `id_token`
(broad OIDC-client compatibility).

## Run locally

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and a reachable Postgres.

```bash
uv sync                         # builds .venv from uv.lock on Python 3.14

cp .env.example .env            # then edit DATABASE_URL etc.
createdb corlissdb              # or point DATABASE_URL at an existing DB
./manage.py generate_keys       # dev signing keys, written to ./keys/

./manage.py migrate
./manage.py collectstatic --noinput   # whitenoise manifest storage needs this
./manage.py runserver
```

`manage.py` carries a `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run` shebang, so `./manage.py …`
syncs the environment from the lockfile and runs in one step — there is no venv
to activate. `uv run python manage.py …` is the explicit equivalent.

Configuration is entirely env-driven — see [`.env.example`](.env.example) for
the full list. `.env` is git-ignored; **never commit secrets or private keys**.
`CHAT_URL` drives the nav's "Chat" link and can be left blank.

### Why atproto login can't work over localhost

The authorization server fetches our `client-metadata.json` **server-side** over
public HTTPS — the `client_id` *is* that URL. Loopback is not reachable from
Bluesky's entryway, so no amount of local configuration makes a real login
complete. Nothing is misconfigured when this fails; it is the protocol.

atproto does define a development exception (a `client_id` with origin
`http://localhost`, carrying `redirect_uri` and `scope` as query parameters).
Corliss deliberately does not use it. It requires an empty path and no port,
which our `client_id` — `<PUBLIC_BASE_URL>/auth/client-metadata.json` — can
never satisfy; it forces `token_endpoint_auth_method: none`, making Corliss a
*public* client, so the `private_key_jwt` client assertion we actually deploy
would never execute; and the auth server synthesizes metadata rather than
fetching ours, skipping the document most likely to be misconfigured. It is
lowest fidelity exactly where this app is most likely to break.

So there are two local workflows, for two different jobs.

#### Local dev without atproto (the common case)

For the OIDC half, the templates, the admin, and relying-party wiring — none of
which needs the handshake — enable the development sign-in:

```bash
DEV_LOGIN_ENABLED=true      # in .env, alongside DEBUG=true
```

The login page then offers a second box that signs you in as any handle you
type. Members it creates are keyed on `did:dev:<handle>` — `did:dev` is not a
registered DID method, so these rows can never collide with a real atproto DID
and are obvious as fakes in the admin.

**This is a complete authentication bypass** — it verifies nothing. Three
guards keep it local: it is off by default, the route is only registered when
`DEBUG` and `DEV_LOGIN_ENABLED` are both true (and the view re-checks), and
`manage.py check` **errors** if the flag is set without `DEBUG`, so a
production env file carrying it fails the deploy's `migrate`/`collectstatic`
rather than quietly serving an open door.

It proves nothing about the atproto client. Use a tunnel for that.

#### Real atproto login locally (a named tunnel)

A quick `cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:8000` works, but its
hostname changes every run and three env vars have to chase it. A **named**
tunnel gets a stable hostname you configure once:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
cloudflared tunnel create corliss-dev
cloudflared tunnel route dns corliss-dev corliss-dev.example.com
```

Then in `.env` — all three, since Django rejects the host otherwise and the
`client_id` must match what the auth server fetches:

```bash
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://corliss-dev.example.com
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://corliss-dev.example.com
ALLOWED_HOSTS=corliss-dev.example.com,localhost,127.0.0.1
```

Run the tunnel alongside `runserver`:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel run --url http://127.0.0.1:8000 corliss-dev
```

Confirm the auth server can see what it needs before trying to log in — this is
the same fetch it will make:

```bash
curl https://corliss-dev.example.com/auth/client-metadata.json
```

This exercises the true production path: PAR, PKCE, DPoP, `private_key_jwt`,
and a real metadata fetch.

### Tests

```bash
./manage.py collectstatic --noinput   # once; page tests render {% static %}
./manage.py test
```

### Checking for updates

Dependencies are declared in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) and pinned —
exactly, by `==` — with the full tree including transitives locked in
[`uv.lock`](uv.lock). Both are committed, so every environment resolves to the
same versions. Upgrades are therefore always a deliberate, reviewable edit
rather than a silent drift at install time.

To see what has moved upstream:

```bash
uv tree --outdated --depth 1   # direct dependencies, current vs latest
uv pip list --outdated         # the whole installed tree
```

To take an upgrade, edit the `==` pin in `pyproject.toml`, then:

```bash
uv lock                        # re-resolve, re-pinning transitives around it
uv sync
./manage.py test
```

Note that `uv lock --upgrade` will not move a direct dependency here — an exact
pin leaves the resolver no room. It does still refresh transitives, which is
worth doing periodically on its own.

### Admin

```bash
manage.py make_admin alice.bsky.social   # promote an ATProto identity (keyed on DID)
manage.py ensure_admin                   # idempotent break-glass local admin;
                                         #   reads CORLISS_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Path |
| -------- | ---- |
| Landing (authenticated) | `/` |
| Login / logout | `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout` |
| ATProto callback | `/auth/oauth/callback` |
| ATProto client metadata (**is** the `client_id`) | `/auth/client-metadata.json` |
| OIDC discovery | `/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| JWKS | `/.well-known/jwks.json` |
| OIDC authorize / token | `/oidc/authorize`, `/oidc/token` |
| Django admin | `/admin/` |

Discovery and JWKS sit at the root deliberately: an OIDC issuer of
`https://example.com` must serve its discovery document at
`https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

## Wiring up a relying party (Open WebUI shown)

```bash
ENABLE_OAUTH_SIGNUP=true
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=open-webui                       # must equal OIDC_CLIENT_ID here
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<shared secret>              # must equal OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET here
OPENID_PROVIDER_URL=https://<PUBLIC_BASE_URL>/.well-known/openid-configuration
OAUTH_SCOPES=openid email profile
OAUTH_USERNAME_CLAIM=handle                      # we emit `handle` (= the atproto handle)
OAUTH_EMAIL_CLAIM=email                          # present when the member's PDS supplied one
```

Register the RP's redirect URI in Corliss's `OIDC_REDIRECT_URIS`
(e.g. `https://chat.example.com/oauth/oidc/callback`).

**`id_token` claims:** `sub` = DID, `handle` (also `preferred_username`),
`iss`/`aud`/`exp`/`iat`/`nonce`, plus `email` + `email_verified` when the
member's PDS supplied one. Email is best-effort — sourced at login via the
`transition:email` scope and `com.atproto.server.getSession` — so a member who
declines the scope simply gets no `email` claim. DID is the only stable
identifier; never key on handle or email.

## Deployment

Corliss runs under gunicorn + whitenoise against Postgres; every deployment
value is an environment variable, so it has no opinion about how it's shipped.
It is deployed to the Z-Space AI cluster by the `corliss` Ansible role in
[zai-ops](https://github.com/Z-Space-Society/zai-ops), which clones this repo
at a pinned ref, provisions the venv with `uv sync --locked --no-dev`,
migrates, collects static, and renders the env file. `--locked` makes the
deploy fail loudly if `uv.lock` is stale against `pyproject.toml` rather than
quietly resolving something else, so the cluster runs the exact tree committed
here. The interpreter is a uv-managed CPython 3.14 — Debian 13's system Python
is 3.13, so the role fetches its own rather than using the distro's.

Required in production: `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`,
`PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, the two key paths, and the
`OIDC_CLIENT_*` values.
